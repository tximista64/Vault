# Information Gathering


### Spoofing

Because emails do not necessarily have an authentication mechanism, 
attackers can send emails in the name of someone else. Attackers can do 
this by using a technique called spoofing to make the user believe that 
the incoming email is reliable. Several protocols have been created to 
prevent the email spoofing technique. The SPF, DKIM, and DMARC protocols
 can be used to determine whether the sender's address is fake or real. 
Some email programs check emails automatically. However, the use of 
these protocols is not mandatory and can cause problems in some cases.

- Sender Policy Framework (SPF)
- DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM)

To manually determine if a mail is spoofed or not, the SMTP address 
of the mail should first be identified. The domain's SPF, DKIM, DMARC, 
and MX records can be obtained using tools such as Mxtoolbox. Comparing 
this information will tell you if the email is spoofed or not.

As large institutions using their own mail servers will have their 
own IP addresses, you can check whether the SMTP address belongs to that
 institution or not by looking at the Whois records of the SMTP IP 
address.

It is also worth noting that even if the sender's address is not 
spoofed, we cannot say that the email is safe. Harmful emails can be 
sent in the name of trusted individuals by hacking corporate/personal 
email addresses. Such cyber-attacks have happened in the past, so it is 
always worth considering the possibility.

### E-mail Traffic Analysis

Many parameters are needed to analyze a phishing attack. The 
following parameters can give us an idea of the size of the attack and 
the target audience if we perform a search on the mail gateway.

- Sender Address(info@letsdefend.io)
- SMTP IP Address(127.0.0.1)
- @letsdefend.io (domain base)
- letsdefend (In addition to the Gmail account, the attacker may have sent from the Hotmail account)
- Subject (sender address and SMTP address may be constantly changing)

In addition to the email numbers, it is necessary to know the 
recipients' addresses and time information in the search results. If 
malicious emails are constantly being forwarded to the same users, their
 email addresses may have somehow been leaked and shared on sites such 
as PasteBin.

Attackers can find email addresses using the Harvester tool on Kali 
Linux. Posting personal email addresses on websites could provide a 
potential attack vector for attackers, so it is recommended that such 
information is not explicitly shared.
