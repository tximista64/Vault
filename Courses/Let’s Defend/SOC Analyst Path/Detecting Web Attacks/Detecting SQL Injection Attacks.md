# Detecting SQL Injection Attacks


## **What is SQL Injection (SQLi)?**

SQL Injections are critical attack vectors in which a web application
 directly includes unsanitized user-provided data in SQL queries.

The frameworks we use today to develop web applications have 
preventative mechanisms in place to protect against SQL Injection 
attacks. However, we still come across SQL injection vulnerabilities 
because sometimes raw SQL queries are used, sometimes the framework has 
an inherent SQL injection vulnerability, or the framework is not used 
properly.

### **Types of SQL Injections**

There are 3 types of SQL Injection. These are:

1. **In-band SQLi (Classic SQLi)**: When an SQL query is
sent and responded to on the same channel, we call this in-band SQLi.
This is easier for attackers to exploit than other categories of SQLi.
2. **Inferential SQLi (Blind SQLi):** SQL queries that
receive a response that cannot be seen are called Inferential SQLi. They are also called "Blind SQLi" because the response cannot be seen.
3. **Out-of-band SQLi**: If the response to an SQL query
is communicated through another channel, this type of SQLi is called
"out-of-band SQLi". For example, if the attacker receives replies to the SQL queries via DNS, this is called out-of-band SQLi.

## **How Does SQL Injection Work?**

Today, most standard web applications receive data from a user and 
use that data to display specific content. The login page is where most 
SQL injection attacks occur. Let's look at how SQL injections work 
through an example.

A user is usually expected to enter their username and password on 
the login page. Then, on the other side, the web application will use 
this username and password information to create an SQL query like the 
one below:

> SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = 'USERNAME’ AND password = 'USER_PASSWORD'
> 

The meaning of this SQL query is "Bring me all the information about the user from the user's table whose name is **USERNAME** and whose password is **USER_PASSWORD**".
 If the web application finds a matching user, it will authenticate the 
user, if it cannot find a user after executing the query, the login will
 fail.

![](https://ld-images-2.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Detecting+Web+Attacks/images/Login-page.png)

Let's say your username is "**john**" and your password is "**supersecretpassword**".
 When you enter this information and click the 'Login' button, the SQL 
query shown below will be queried and you will be able to log in because
 a match was found after the SQL query.

> SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = ‘john’ AND password = 'supersecretpassword'
> 

So what if we do not use this system as it was designed and we put an
 apostrophe (') in the username field? The SQL query will look like this
 and the error will be excluded from the database because the query was 
incorrect.

> SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = ‘john’’ AND password = 'supersecretpassword'
> 

![](https://ld-images-2.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Detecting+Web+Attacks/images/SQL-Injection-login-page.png)

Of course, an attacker would be pleased to get an error message, as 
they can manipulate the information in the error message to their 
advantage. It also shows that the attacker is on the right track. So 
what if the attacker enters a payload like the following in the username
 section?

> ‘ OR 1=1 -- -
> 

When the attacker submits the payload, the web application executes the following SQL query:

> SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = ‘’ OR 1=1 -- - AND password = 'supersecretpassword'
> 

In SQL, any characters after "-- -" are considered to be a comment 
line. So if we look at the query above, the characters after "-- -" mean
 nothing. So, for the sake of simplicity, let's remove that part before 
we examine the SQL query further.

> SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = ‘’ OR 1=1
> 

The query above now looks like this "**if the username is empty or 1=1**".
 It does not matter whether the username field is empty or not, because 1
 is always equal to 1. So this query will always be true and will most 
likely call the first entry in the database. The attacker will be able 
to successfully enter the web application because there is a match.

This is a typical SQL injection attack. Of course, SQL injection 
attacks are not limited to this example, the attacker could use SQL to 
execute commands in the system using SQL commands such as **xp_cmdshell**.

## **What Attackers Gain from SQL Injection Attacks**

To understand why SQL injection attacks are so important, let's take a look at what an SQL injection attack can do.

- Authentication bypass
- Command execution
- Exfiltration of sensitive data
- Creating/Deleting/Updating database entries

## **How to Prevent SQL Injections**

- **Use a framework:** Of course, just using a framework
is not enough to prevent a SQL injection attack. However, it is still
very important to use the framework according to the documentation.
- **Keep your framework up to date:** Keep your web application secure by following security updates according to the framework you use.
- **Always sanitize data received from a user:** Never trust data received from a user. In addition, sanitize all data (such as headers, URLs, etc.), not just form data.
- **Avoid the use of raw SQL queries:** You may be in the habit of writing raw SQL queries, but you should take advantage of the security provided by the framework.

## **Detecting SQL Injection Attacks**

In the previous section, we discussed what an attacker can do with a 
SQL injection attack. Each of the results of a SQL Injection mentioned 
above can cause great damage to an organization, so as SOC analysts we 
should be able to detect these attacks and take precautions against 
them.

So how do we detect SQL injection attacks?

There is more than one answer to this question:

- **When examining a web request, check all areas that come from the user:** As SQL injection attacks are not limited to the form areas, you should
also check the HTTP request headers such as the "User-Agent".
- **Look for SQL keywords:** Look for words such as "INSERT", "SELECT", and "WHERE" in the data received from users.
- **Check any special characters:** Look for apostrophes
('), dashes (-), or parentheses used in SQL or special characters
commonly used in SQL attacks in the data received from the user.
- **Familiarise yourself with commonly used SQL injection payloads:** Although SQL payloads change depending on the web application,
attackers still use some common payloads to test for SQL injection
vulnerabilities. If you are familiar with these payloads, you can easily detect SQL injection payloads. You can find some commonly used SQL
injection payloads .

### **Detecting Automated SQL Injection Tools**

Attackers use many automated tools to detect SQL injection 
vulnerabilities. One of the well-known tools is Sqlmap. However, let's 
look at the bigger picture rather than focusing on one particular tool.

You can use the following methods to detect SQL injection tools:

1. **Look at the User-Agent:** Automated tools usually have their names and versions recorded. You can look at the User-Agent to detect these automated tools.
2. **Check the frequency of requests:** Automated tools
are designed to send an estimated number of requests per second to test
payloads as quickly as possible. A normal user might send 1 request per
second, so looking at the number of requests per second will tell you if the requests are from an automated tool or not.
3. **Look at the content of the payload:** Automated tools usually include their own names in their payloads. For example, an SQL
injection payload sent by an automated tool might look like this: **sqlmap’ OR 1=1**
4. **If the payload is complicated:** This detection method may not always work, but based on my experience I
could say that automated tools send more complicated payloads.

### **A Detection Example**

We have access logs of a web application that was the victim of a SQL injection attack.

You may not know what an access log is. In a nutshell, they are the 
access logs from the web server. These logs usually contain the source 
IP address, date, requested URL, HTTP method, user agent, and HTTP 
response code, and they are very useful for investigations.

![](https://ld-images-2.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Detecting+Web+Attacks/images/sql-injection-access-log.png)

(SQL Injection Access Logs)

We have an access log in hand. What do we do now?

First of all, if we look at the pages that were requested, we see 
that besides pages like "info.php", which is quite readable, there are 
also requests for pages that are complex and contain symbols like %. We 
cannot say that requests for pages like this are malicious, but the fact
 that they are repeated many times is suspicious.

Next, let's talk about what the % symbols mean. When we request a 
page that contains special characters, these requests are not sent 
directly to the web server. Instead, our browsers perform a URL encoding
 ("Percent Encoding") of the special characters and replace each special
 character with a string that starts with % and contains 2 hexadecimal 
characters. So the pages that contain the % symbol above are pages that 
contain special characters.

![](https://ld-images-2.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Detecting+Web+Attacks/images/URL-Encoding.png)

Now that we understand what the % symbols mean, let's revisit the 
access logs. If we look at the requests, we can easily see that there 
are readable words such as "UNION", "SELECT", "AND", and "CHR" next to 
the % symbols.  As these are specific words belonging to SQL, we can see
 that we are facing an SQL injection attack.

To protect our eyes, let's make the investigation a bit easier :) You
 can search with the keywords " Online URL Decoder " to find web 
applications that automatically decode URLs for you. To make it easier 
to read these access logs, we'll get help from these web applications, 
so we don't have to strain our eyes.

**Please note this:** It is not wise to upload something
 like access logs, which contain critical information, to a 3rd party 
web application. The access logs uploaded in this course have been 
prepared specifically for educational purposes; don't make such a 
mistake in your professional life.

![](https://ld-images-2.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Detecting+Web+Attacks/images/Access-logs-with-URL-decoding.png)

When we decode the URL, we can see more clearly that this is a SQL injection attack. So what do we do now?

We are going to find any other information we can from these access logs.

![](https://ld-images-2.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Detecting+Web+Attacks/images/sql-injection-access-logs-date.png)

First, let's look at the request times. All the SQL injection 
payloads were sent on "19/Feb/2022 11:09:24". We can see that more than 
50 requests were made in 1 second. The fact that so many requests were 
made in such a short period indicates that this is an automated attack. 
In addition, as we mentioned earlier when attackers do manual testing, 
they choose to test simple payloads first. But when we look at the 
access logs, we see that the payloads are very complicated. This shows 
that the attack could be automated.

We have confirmed that an SQL injection attack was performed and that
 it was performed with an automated tool. So we can finish our analysis,
 right?

There is one more step to take. We need to determine whether or not 
the attack was successful. You can determine whether a SQL injection 
attack has been successful by looking at the response, but in real life,
 you will almost never have access to the response. We can assume that 
all responses will be about the same size because the attack is on the 
same page and via the "id" variable, and estimate the success of the 
attack by looking at the size of the response.

Unfortunately, the simple web server developed as an example cannot 
provide a reliable response size. Therefore, we cannot estimate whether 
the attack was successful by looking at this example. However, for 
correctly configured web servers, we can find the response size in the 
access logs. You can examine this area to see if there is a noticeable 
difference in response sizes. If there is a noticeable difference, then 
you can assume that the attack was successful. However, in this 
situation, it would be best to escalate this alert to a senior analyst.

So far we have covered that:

1. There has been an SQL injection attack on the 'id' parameter on the main page of the web application.
2. The requests came from IP address 192.168.31.174.
3. As there were more than 50 requests per second, this attack was carried out by an automated vulnerability scanning tool.
4. The complex nature of the payloads supports the assertion in #3.
5. We cannot determine if the response was successful or not as we have no information on the size of the response.
