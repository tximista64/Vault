# Detecting Brute Force Attacks


## What is Brute Forcing?

Brute forcing is a type of attack that involves attempting to guess a
 password or authentication token by systematically trying every 
possible combination of characters until the correct one is found. In 
the context of web attacks, brute forcing typically refers to the 
process of using automated tools to repeatedly submit login requests to a
 web application using different username and password combinations 
until a valid one is discovered.

Brute force attacks can be used to gain unauthorized access to a 
system, steal sensitive information, or launch further attacks against 
the target or other systems. They can be particularly effective against 
weak or poorly protected passwords, but can also be very time-consuming 
and resource-intensive for the attacker, especially if the target system
 has implemented measures to detect and block brute force attacks.

Brute force attacks are one of the simplest and most straightforward 
methods of attacking a web application, and it works by systematically 
trying every possible combination of usernames and passwords until the 
correct one is found. This process is typically automated using 
specialized software or scripts, which can try thousands or even 
millions of combinations per second.

The basic idea behind a brute force attack is to exploit the weak or 
easily guessable passwords that a lot of people use especially the 
non-techy users, such as common dictionary words, simple number 
sequences, or their own names or birthdates. By systematically trying 
every possible combination of characters, attackers can eventually find 
the correct password and gain access to the target system.

## Brute Forcing Possible Vectors

Brute forcing on web applications is a common attack vector used by 
hackers to gain unauthorized access to user accounts or web servers. In 
this type of attack, the attacker will use automated tools to submit 
multiple login requests to the targeted web application using different 
usernames and passwords, in an attempt to find the correct credentials 
and gain access to the system.

Web applications are particularly vulnerable to brute force attacks 
because they are often accessible over the internet and rely on user 
authentication to control access to sensitive data or functionality. If 
an attacker is able to guess a valid username and password, they can 
potentially gain access to sensitive user data, such as financial 
information, personal data, or confidential business information.

Actually, it’s not just guessing usernames and passwords also, 
directory brute forcing on web applications is another type of brute 
force attack that involves guessing file or directory names on a web 
server in order to find hidden or sensitive files or directories. In 
this type of attack, the attacker will use automated tools to submit 
requests to the targeted web server using different file or directory 
names, in an attempt to find files or directories that are not meant to 
be publicly accessible.

This type of attack can be effective against web applications that do
 not implement proper access controls or that have poorly configured web
 servers. To prevent directory brute force attacks, web application 
developers can implement access controls to restrict access to sensitive
 files and directories, and can configure their web servers to block 
requests for known sensitive files and directories.

## How Brute Forcing Works?

Here's an example of vulnerable code that is susceptible to Brute Forcing attacks in a PHP script:

This form is vulnerable to brute force attacks because it allows 
unlimited login attempts and does not implement any security measures to
 prevent automated login attempts.

Here's an example of how you can use Python requests library to send 
multiple login requests with a list of usernames and passwords:

## Impact of Brute Forcing

Brute forcing can have significant impacts on a target system or 
application. Here are some of the potential impacts of brute forcing:

1. **Denial of service:** Brute forcing can consume a
significant amount of computing resources, such as CPU cycles and
memory, which can lead to system slowdowns or crashes. This can cause a
denial of service (DoS) attack, which makes the target system
unavailable to legitimate users.
2. **Data leakage:** Successful brute force
attacks can allow unauthorized access to sensitive data, such as login
credentials, personal information, financial data, and intellectual
property. This can lead to data breaches, which can have severe
consequences for the target organization, including financial losses and damage to reputation.
3. **Account takeover:** Brute forcing can
allow attackers to gain access to user accounts without the owner's
consent. Once an attacker has access to an account, they can carry out
malicious activities, such as stealing data, sending spam, or carrying
out further attacks.
4. **Password reuse:** Brute forcing can
reveal weak or easily guessable passwords, which can encourage users to
reuse passwords across multiple accounts. This can increase the risk of
compromise, as a successful brute force attack on one account can
provide access to multiple accounts.
5. **Legal and reputational consequences:**
Brute forcing is illegal and unethical, and can result in significant
legal and reputational consequences for individuals and organizations
who engage in it. If caught, attackers can face criminal charges, fines, and other penalties. Additionally, organizations who are victims of
brute force attacks may suffer reputational damage, loss of trust from
customers and stakeholders, and legal liability for failing to protect
their systems and data.

## Prevention Methods for Brute Forcing

Implement account lockout policies: After a certain number of failed 
login attempts, lock the user account for a specified period of time, to
 prevent further login attempts. This will make brute force attacks more
 difficult, as the attacker will need to wait for the account to become 
unlocked before attempting more login attempts.

**Implement CAPTCHA:** Use CAPTCHA or other bot detection mechanisms to detect automated login attempts and prevent them from succeeding.

**Limit the rate of login attempts:**
 Implement a mechanism that limits the number of login attempts that can
 be made within a certain time period (e.g. 5 login attempts per 
minute). This will slow down brute force attacks, as the attacker will 
need to wait between attempts.

**Use multi-factor authentication:**
 Require users to provide additional authentication factors, such as a 
one-time code sent via SMS or email, in addition to their username and 
password.

**Monitoring login attempts:** 
This involves monitoring login attempts for signs of suspicious 
activity, such as multiple failed login attempts from the same IP 
address, or unusual spikes in traffic or requests. This can help to 
detect and prevent brute force attacks before they are successful.

**Using strong passwords and password policies:**
 This involves requiring users to choose strong passwords that are 
difficult to guess, and enforcing password policies that require users 
to change their passwords regularly and prohibiting the use of weak or 
easily guessable passwords.

Web Application Firewalls (WAFs) are commonly used to protect web 
applications from various types of attacks, including brute force 
attacks. Here are some ways WAFs can prevent brute force attacks;

IP blocking: WAFs can block access to the web application from IP 
addresses that have made excessive login attempts or have triggered 
other security rules. This can prevent brute force attacks by blocking 
the attacker's access to the application altogether.

User behavior analysis: WAFs can analyze user behavior patterns to 
detect abnormal activity, such as a high rate of login attempts or 
unusual login times. This can help prevent brute force attacks by 
detecting and blocking suspicious behavior before it becomes a problem.

It's important to note that WAFs are not foolproof and can be 
bypassed by skilled attackers. Therefore, it's important to implement 
multiple layers of security controls, such as strong passwords, account 
lockout policies, and security awareness trainings for users, in 
addition to using  WAFs.

By implementing these measures, the login form can be more secure, robust, and resistant to brute-force attacks.

## Detecting Brute Forcing Attacks

In Part 1, we have described what the Brute Forcing is and how to 
prevent this attack type. In this part, we’ll have a look at the 
detection techniques and some tips to make it easier to detect and 
prevent brute force attacks.

Analyzing brute force attacks can help you understand the methods 
used by attackers and identify vulnerabilities in your security 
controls. To do this, you should **collect and store** authentication logs from your web application, including the successful logins as well as the failed login attempts. Look for **patterns of suspicious activity** in the authentication logs, such as a high number of failed login attempts from a **particular IP address** or user account. **Analyze network traffic logs**
 to identify patterns of traffic that may be associated with brute force
 attacks, such as repeated login attempts from the same IP address or 
requests to non-existent pages or directories.

Deploy an **intrusion detection system (IDS) or intrusion prevention system (IPS)** to analyze network traffic and detect signs of brute force attacks. **Look for common attack vectors**
 used in brute force attacks, such as dictionary attacks or password 
spraying. Identify user accounts that are vulnerable to brute force 
attacks due to weak passwords or other vulnerabilities. Finally, monitor
 for incidents of brute force attacks and respond to them promptly **by blocking malicious IP addresses**,
 locking out user accounts, and implementing additional security 
controls as necessary. By following these steps, you can strengthen your
 security controls and reduce the risk of successful brute force 
attacks.

Example Nginx log file that contains Brute Force attack;

![](https://letsdefend-images.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Courses/Detecting-Web-Attacks-2/brute+force/img3.png)

The log file provided shows the unsuccessful login attempts only. In 
order to detect the successful login attempts, you would need to analyze
 the logs further or modify your logging configuration to include the 
successful login attempts as well.

Successful login attempts would typically result in a response code 
of 200 or a redirect to a different page, which can be identified in the
 log file. However, keep in mind that some attackers may attempt to 
obfuscate their successful login attempts by logging in with valid 
credentials or using a compromised account, so it is important to 
perform further analysis to determine if any suspicious activity is 
occurring.

![](https://letsdefend-images.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Courses/Detecting-Web-Attacks-2/brute+force/img4.png)

In this example, the log entry shows a POST request to the **/login.php** page with a response code of **302**, which indicates a successful login attempt. The **Cookie** header also includes a **PHPSESSID**
 value and a login value, which may be used to track the user session 
and authentication status. Note that the exact format and contents of 
the log files can vary depending on the web server and its 
configuration.

To detect brute force attacks in nginx log files, you can use various tools and techniques such as:

**Log analysis tools:** There are 
several log analysis tools such as Logstash, ElasticSearch, and Kibana 
(ELK Stack) that can help you analyze nginx log files and detect brute 
force attacks. These tools will allow you to search for specific 
patterns in the log files, such as repeated failed login attempts from 
the same IP address or user agent.

**Regular expressions:** Regular 
expressions can be used to search for specific patterns in the log 
files. For example, you can use a regular expression to match a sequence
 of repeated failed login attempts from the same IP address or user 
agent.

***Things that you can do after the detection:***

**Fail2ban:** Fail2ban is a 
popular intrusion prevention tool that can be used to automatically 
block the IP addresses that are detected as engaging in brute force 
attacks. Fail2ban works by monitoring the nginx log files and applying 
predefined filters to detect and block suspicious activity.

**IP blocking:** You can manually 
block IP addresses that are detected as engaging in brute force attacks 
by adding them to the nginx configuration file. For example, you can use
 the deny rule to block traffic from specific IP addresses:

![](https://letsdefend-images.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Courses/Detecting-Web-Attacks-2/brute+force/img5.png)

It's important to note that detecting brute force attacks is not 
always a straightforward process and may require additional analysis and
 investigation to identify the suspicious activity accurately.

Here's an example of a regular expression that can be used to detect 
repeated failed login attempts from the same IP address in an nginx log 
file:

/^(\S+) \S+ \S+ \[.*?\] "(POST|GET) \/login\.php.*?" (401|403) \d+ ".*?" ".*?"/gm

This regular expression will match any log file entry that includes a failed login attempt **(401 or 403 status code)** to the **/login.php** page. It will capture the IP address of the client making the request in the first capture group **((\S+))**.
 You can then use a log analysis tool or script to count the number of 
times each IP address appears in the log file and flag any IP addresses 
that have a high number of failed login attempts as potential brute 
force attackers. Also, you can update the regex’s IP address as 
suspicious IP source.

In this lesson, we have covered the Brute Forcing attack. We have 
talked about how the vulnerability appears, as well as the detection and
 the prevention methods.
