# Detecting XML External Entity Attacks


## What is XML External Entity?

For a better understanding let’s quickly look at what XML is.

XML (Extensible Markup Language) is a markup language that is used 
for structuring and storing data in a structured format that is both 
human-readable and machine-readable. XML was developed as a successor to
 HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) and is widely used for data exchange 
between different systems and platforms, particularly on the web.

XML uses a set of tags to define the structure and content of the 
data being represented. These tags are used to identify and describe 
various elements and attributes of the data, such as tags for opening 
and closing elements, attributes for specifying additional information 
about the element, and entities for representing special characters and 
symbols.

One of the key advantages of XML is its flexibility and 
extensibility. It is possible to define custom tags and schemas for 
representing data, making it a powerful tool for representing complex 
data structures and exchanging data between different systems.

While XML was once widely used for a variety of purposes, its usage 
has declined in recent years as newer data formats like JSON have gained
 popularity with its simplicity, ease of use, and better support for 
modern web technologies.

XXE (XML External Entity) vulnerability is a type of security 
vulnerability that affects applications that parse XML input. In an XXE 
attack, an attacker injects malicious XML data into an application that 
uses an XML parser without proper validation, which can result in the 
application processing external entities that can be controlled by the 
attacker.

An external entity is a piece of XML that is defined outside of the 
XML document, but can be referenced and included within the document. An
 attacker can exploit an XXE vulnerability to include malicious external
 entities that can read local files, access internal systems, or perform
 other malicious actions on the server.

XXE vulnerabilities can be exploited in various ways, such as through
 web forms that accept XML input, SOAP and REST APIs that use XML-based 
payloads, or other applications that accept and process XML input. These
 attacks can lead to sensitive data leaks, server-side request forgery 
(SSRF), denial of service (DoS) attacks, and other serious security 
issues.

It is important for developers to be aware of XXE vulnerabilities and
 take steps to prevent them, such as disabling external entities, 
validating and sanitizing XML input, and using secure XML parsers that 
are specifically designed to prevent XXE attacks.

## XML External Entity Possible Vectors

To find XML External Entity (XXE) vulnerabilities in a web 
application, you can start by examining the application's XML processing
 code to identify any input points that accept XML input. These input 
points could include:

1. Form fields that accept XML input
2. XML files uploaded by users
3. APIs that accept XML requests
4. XML files used for configuration or other purposes

Once you have identified the input points that accept XML input, you 
can test them for XXE vulnerabilities by providing input that includes 
external entity references and observing the application's response.

You can also use automated vulnerability scanners and penetration 
testing tools that can detect and exploit XXE vulnerabilities. These 
tools can send various payloads that include external entity references 
and observe the response to determine if the application is vulnerable.

## How XML External Entity Works?

XXE attacks can depend on the programming language used by the 
server-side application. The XXE attack vector exploits a vulnerability 
in the XML parser of the server-side application, and the specific 
vulnerabilities and defenses can vary depending on the programming 
language used.

For example, PHP has a built-in XML parser called DOMDocument that is
 often used in web applications. The parser can be vulnerable to XXE 
attacks if the XML input is not properly validated and sanitized, and 
external entities are not disabled. As a defense, developers can use the
 libxml_disable_entity_loader() function to disable the loading of 
external entities in PHP.

Here's an example of vulnerable PHP code that demonstrates an XXE vulnerability:

![](https://letsdefend-images.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Courses/Detecting-Web-Attacks-2/xxe/img1.png)

In this example, the PHP script accepts an XML input parameter named 
"xml" and uses the loadXML() method of the DOMDocument class to parse it
 into a DOMDocument object. However, the code does not properly validate
 or sanitize the XML input, which can allow an attacker to inject an 
external entity and perform a variety of malicious actions.

An attacker could send the following XML input to exploit the XXE vulnerability:

![](https://letsdefend-images.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Courses/Detecting-Web-Attacks-2/xxe/img2.png)

In this XML input, the attacker defines a new external entity called 
"xxe" that references the "/etc/passwd" file on the server. When the PHP
 script processes this input, it will load the "/etc/passwd" file and 
include its contents in the output, which can allow the attacker to read
 sensitive information from the server.

To prevent XXE attacks in PHP, it is important to validate and 
sanitize any XML input properly and disable the processing of external 
entities whenever possible. You can use the 
libxml_disable_entity_loader() function to disable the loading of 
external entities in PHP. Additionally, you can use input validation and
 sanitization functions such as filter_var() to ensure that the XML 
input is properly formatted and does not contain any malicious payloads.

Let’s take a look at how XXE vulnerability appears in Java servlet applications;

![](https://letsdefend-images.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Courses/Detecting-Web-Attacks-2/xxe/img3.png)

In this example, the servlet accepts an XML input parameter named 
"xml" and uses a DocumentBuilder object to parse it into a Document 
object. However, the code does not properly validate or sanitize the XML
 input, which can allow an attacker to inject an external entity and 
perform a variety of malicious actions.

An attacker could send the following XML input to exploit the XXE vulnerability:

![](https://letsdefend-images.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Courses/Detecting-Web-Attacks-2/xxe/img4.png)

In this payload, we define an external entity xxe that points to a remote XML file **http://attacker.com/xxe.xml**. Then, we include the entity within the **<data>** element using the &xxe; syntax.

When the XML parser processes this payload, it will attempt to fetch 
the remote xxe.xml file specified in the xxe entity. If the server 
hosting the vulnerable application is vulnerable to SSRF, this can 
result in the attacker being able to access internal systems or perform 
other malicious actions on the server.

## Impact of XML External Entity

The impact of an XXE vulnerability can vary depending on the specific
 vulnerability and the context of the application. In general, however, 
an XXE vulnerability can be quite serious and can result in a range of 
harmful outcomes, including:

1. **Information disclosure:** An attacker can use an
XXE vulnerability to access sensitive data from the server with
read/write capability that will allow the attacker to modify/transfer
the data, such as configuration files, user credentials, and other
sensitive information.
2. **Server-side request forgery (SSRF):** An attacker can use an XXE vulnerability to make requests on behalf of
the server, allowing them to scan internal networks, exploit other
vulnerabilities, and carry out further attacks.
3. **Denial of service (DoS):** An attacker can use an XXE vulnerability to launch a DoS attack by
sending an XML input that causes the server to consume excessive
resources, such as memory or CPU time.
4. **Remote code execution (RCE):** In some cases, an attacker can use an XXE vulnerability to execute
arbitrary code on the server, allowing them to take full control of the
server and carry out further attacks.

Therefore, it is important to identify and remediate XXE 
vulnerabilities in web applications to prevent these and other harmful 
outcomes. Best practices for preventing XXE attacks include properly 
validating and sanitizing all XML input, disabling the processing of 
external entities, and using the latest secure versions of XML parsers 
and frameworks.

## Prevention Methods for XML External Entity

There are several best practices that can help prevent XXE attacks:

**Disable external entities:** One
 of the most effective ways to prevent XXE attacks is to disable the 
processing of external entities in the XML parser configuration. This 
can be done by setting the appropriate parser configuration or using a 
secure XML parser that has external entity processing disabled by 
default.

**Input validation and sanitization:** Always
 validate and sanitize all XML input before parsing it. This includes 
checking for malicious input such as nested XML entities, XML 
injections, and other forms of malicious input.

**Use secure parsers:** Use the 
latest version of a secure XML parser that has been specifically 
designed to prevent XXE attacks. These parsers have features that can 
help detect and prevent XXE attacks.

**Use whitelist filtering:** Implementing
 a whitelist of allowed entities and DTDs can help reduce the risk of 
XXE attacks by blocking any input that is not on the whitelist.

**Implement access controls:** 
Implement proper access controls to restrict access to sensitive data 
and resources. This can help limit the damage in case an XXE 
vulnerability is exploited.

**Use secure coding practices:** 
Use secure coding practices, such as input validation, data 
sanitization, and error handling, to minimize the risk of XXE attacks.

By implementing these best practices, you can significantly reduce 
the risk of XXE attacks in your web application. It is important to keep
 up-to-date with the latest security best practices and patches for your
 web application, and to periodically perform security assessments to 
identify and remediate any vulnerabilities.

Here's an example of vulnerable PHP code that is susceptible to XML External Entity attacks:

![](https://letsdefend-images.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Courses/Detecting-Web-Attacks-2/xxe/img5.png)

The code above loads an XML input from the **php://input** stream and passes it directly to the **loadXML()** method of the **DOMDocument** class without any validation or sanitization. This makes it vulnerable to XXE attacks.

To fix this vulnerability, we need to validate and sanitize the XML 
input and disable external entities. Here is an example of a fixed 
version of the code:

![](https://letsdefend-images.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Courses/Detecting-Web-Attacks-2/xxe/img6.png)

In the code above, we have disabled external entities using the function **libxml_disable_entity_loader()**,
 which prevents XXE attacks. We have then validated and sanitized the 
XML input using a regular expression that only allows alphanumeric and 
underscore characters. If the input passes validation, we load it into 
the **DOMDocument** object and output the sanitized XML. If the input fails validation, we output an error message.

This fixed code ensures that the XML input is properly validated, 
sanitized, and processed securely, and is much less vulnerable to XXE 
attacks.

## Detecting XML External Entity Attacks

In Part 1, we have overviewed what the XML External Entity is and how
 to prevent this vulnerability. In this part, we’ll have a look at the 
detection techniques and some tips to make it easier. Before moving on 
let’s take a quick look for example payloads for the XML External Entity
 vulnerability;

**Basic XXE Payload**

![](https://letsdefend-images.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Courses/Detecting-Web-Attacks-2/xxe/img7.png)

**Blind XXE Payload**

![](https://letsdefend-images.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Courses/Detecting-Web-Attacks-2/xxe/img8.png)

**XXE Payload with PHP Filter**

![](https://letsdefend-images.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Courses/Detecting-Web-Attacks-2/xxe/img9.png)

Here's an example of what an Nginx log might look like when an XXE 
attack occurs via a vulnerable parameter on a GET request (This 
methodology is the same as analyzing POST requests):

![](https://letsdefend-images.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Courses/Detecting-Web-Attacks-2/xxe/img10.png)

In this log, the IP address of the client making the request is 
123.45.67.89. The request was a GET request to the processXML endpoint, 
with an xml parameter that contains an XXE payload. The XXE payload 
attempts to read the contents of the /etc/passwd file. The response code
 is 200, indicating that the request was successful, and the response 
size is 143 bytes. The user agent string indicates that the request was 
made from a Chrome browser on a Windows 10 machine.

![](https://letsdefend-images.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Courses/Detecting-Web-Attacks-2/xxe/img11.png)

The most important things to detect XXE attacks on the logs, you should check specific keyword like;

- DOCTYPE
- ELEMENT
- ENTITY

So for the detecting !DOCTYPE keyword in nginx logs, we can use regex like;

^(\S+) - (\S+) \[(.*?)\] "(\S+) (.*?)\?(?=.*?\b21DOCTYPE\b).*? HTTP\/\d\.\d" (\d+) (\d+) "(.*?)" "(.*?)"

![](https://letsdefend-images.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Courses/Detecting-Web-Attacks-2/xxe/img12.png)

21 is for the encoded version of the ! character. Because !DOCTYPE is
 equal to %21DOCTYPE. This regex will match the following line on the 
example that we have shared above;

![](https://letsdefend-images.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Courses/Detecting-Web-Attacks-2/xxe/img13.png)

And decoded versions are;

![](https://letsdefend-images.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Courses/Detecting-Web-Attacks-2/xxe/img14.png)

So, it can be clearly seen that the user sends to XXE payload from 
source IP 123.45.67.89 on dates 30/Apr/2023:12:34:57 and 
30/Apr/2023:12:34:59.

In this lesson, we have covered the XML External Entity attack. We 
have talked about how the vulnerability appears, as well as its 
detection and prevention methods.
